(<a href="#why" class="link"><strong>more info</strong></a>).Unfortunately, native bee populations are rapidly declining (<a href="#why-die" class="link"><strong>more info</strong></a>).

            <h2 class="why-title">Why Are Bees Important?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Bees play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity and supporting ecosystems by pollinating plants. They are responsible for pollinating 75% of the world’s food crops, ensuring we have fruits, vegetables, and other essential foods. Beyond that, native bees help maintain healthy ecosystems by enabling the growth of wild plants, which in turn support other wildlife. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biodiversity</strong> Native bees support a wide variety of plant species, which in turn support other animals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Transfer</strong> Bees enable plants to reproduce, which sustains food chains from plants to herbivores to predators.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon Cycle</strong> When native bees pollinate plants, they enable them to grow and reproduce, which in turn supports the carbon cycle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nitrogen Cycle</strong> In the nitrogen cycle, native bees indirectly contribute by aiding the growth of plants that host nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as legumes. </li>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Bees are essential pollinators that support biodiversity and global food security. However, their populations are declining at alarming rates. The reasons include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Urban development and agriculture reduce the areas where bees can live and feed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pesticides:</strong> Chemicals, especially neonicotinoids (used in agriculture), harm bees' ability to find food and reproduce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Shifting weather patterns affect the availability of flowers, reducing native bees' food sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Invasive Species:</strong> Non-native bees and plants compete with native species for food and space, spreading diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monocultures:</strong> Large-scale farming reduces plant diversity, which is critical for bee nutrition.</li>

        <h2>Native Bees vs. Non-Native Bees</h2>
        <p>Native bees are species that have evolved in specific regions over thousands of years, like bumblebees, sweat bees, and leafcutter bees. Non-native bees, such as the European honeybee, are introduced and often outcompete native bees for resources, leading to ecosystem imbalance.</p>

                <h3>Native Bees</h3>
                <p>Efficient pollinators for native flora, solitary, and less aggressive. <strong>Examples: Bumble-bees, Sweat-bees, Leafcutter bees</strong></p>

                <h3>Non-Native Bees</h3>
                <p>Introduced species, such as honeybees, good for agriculture but can harm native populations.</p>

<!-- HOW Section -->
<section id="how" class="section">
    <h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
    <p>Our planet depends on pollinators like bees to thrive. Here’s how you can take meaningful actions to support native bee populations and contribute to a healthier ecosystem:</p>

            <img src="native-flowers-icon.png" alt="Plant Native Flowers Icon" class="how-icon">
            <h3>Creating Bee-friendly Habitats</h3>
            <p>Choose to plant more native plants! Native flowers provide bees with the nectar and pollen they need to survive, they also contribute to a balanced ecosystem. <br><a href="https://onplants.ca/shop/?plant_type[]=Wildflower" class="link" target="_blank"><strong>Shop for Ontario's Native Plants</strong></a>

            <img src="no-pesticides-icon.png" alt="No Pesticides Icon" class="how-icon">
            <h3>Avoid Pesticides</h3>
            <p>Chemicals in pesticides harm bees and other pollinators. Opt for natural alternatives such as growing certain plants like marigolds or lavender that naturally repel pests, to keep your garden safe for them.</p>

            <h3>Support Local Farmers</h3>
            <p>Buy from local, pesticide-free farms that prioritize bee conservation. Supporting them also strengthens sustainable agriculture.</p>
